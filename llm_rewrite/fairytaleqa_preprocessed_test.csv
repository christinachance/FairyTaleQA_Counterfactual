' well , did you get the wreath ? ' cried he . ' dirty creatures ! ' answered his son . ' do not speak to me like that ! what do you mean ? ' asked the father again . ' dirty creatures ! ' repeated the son , and nothing else could he say . then the man saw that something evil had befallen him , and turned in his rage to his stepson . ' you are at the bottom of this , i know , ' he cried ; and as the mother was out of the way he took a stick and beat the boy till he screamed with pain and went to bed sobbing . if the poor boy 's life had been miserable before , it was ten times worse now , for the moment his mother 's back was turned the others teased and tormented him from morning till night ; and their fury was increased by the sight of his wreath , which the doves had placed again on his head . the day after his marriage the bridegroom sent a messenger , bearing handsome presents to his mother , and telling her of the good fortune which had befallen him . as may be imagined , the stepfather and his son were so filled with envy that they grew quite ill , and had to take to their beds , and nobody would have been sorry it they had never got up again ; but that did not happen . at length , however , they began to feel better , for the father invented a plan by which he could be revenged on the boy who had never done him any harm . everything fell out exactly as the man had hoped . by the aid of his magic mirror the witch beheld the new prince walking in his gardens in a dress of green silk , and in a few minutes had produced a mask so like him , that very few people could have told the difference . however , he counselled the man that when his son first wore it - for that , of course , was what he intended him to do - he had better pretend that he had a toothache , and cover his head with a lace veil . the man thanked him and paid him well , and returned to his hut , carrying the mask under his cloak . in a few days he heard that a great hunt was planned , and the princess would leave the palace very early in the morning , so that her husband would be alone all day . this was a chance not to be missed , and taking his son with him he went up to the palace , where he had never been before . the prince was too happy in his new home to remember all that he had suffered in the old one , and he welcomed them both gladly , and gave them quantities of beautiful things to take back with them . at last he took them down to the shore to see a pleasure boat which his wife had had made for him ; and here , the man seizing his opportunity , stole softly behind the boy and pushed him off the rock on which he was standing , into the deep water , where he instantly sank to the bottom . then he fastened the mask on his son , flung over his shoulders a velvet cloak , which the prince had let fall , and finally arranged a lace veil over his head .",enchanted-wreath,,terribly,,,poorly

' you are my own husband , and i shall never let you go , ' she said . but the words were hardly out of her mouth when she found that it was a hare that she was holding by the paw . then the hare changed into a fish , and the fish into a bird , and the bird into a slimy wriggling snake . this time the princess's hand nearly opened of itself , but with a strong effort she kept her fingers shut , and drawing her sword cut off its head , when the spell was broken , and the boy stood before her as she had seen him first , the wreath upon his head and the birds singing for joy .",enchanted-wreath,,,,outcome resolution,

And there no harm had been done him, save that he had lost the top joint of the little finger of his right hand, and the goblins had been kind to him; yet it had always seemed to him as though something were not as it should be, he felt as though something weighed upon him, and he had suffered greatly from the advances of the dwarf who had been chosen for him as a wife. When Andrea learned who his father and his people were, he saw that they were related to him, and they became very good friends. So Andrea could truly say he had been born under a lucky star. Then they sailed home, and took along the schooner, and all the gold and silver, and all the treasure which had been left in the hut, and then Andrea was far wealthier than his brother. The smoke and the heat nearly killed the eavesdropper in the loft, and in order to catch his breath and get some fresh air, he tried to crawl out of the look-out in the roof; yet he was of much heavier build than his brother, stuck fast and could move neither in nor out. Then he grew frightened and began to scream; but the goblins screamed much louder, and roared and howled, and thumped and clamored inside and outside the hut. But when the hen crowed they disappeared, and Jack Nicholson freed himself, too. Yet when he returned home from his trip, he had lost his reason, and after that the same cold, sinister screams which are the mark of the troll in the northland, might often be heard sounding from store-rooms and lofts where he happened to be. Before his death, however, his reason returned, and he was buried in consecrated ground, as they say. But after that time no human foot ever trod the sand-banks again. They sank, and the meer-folk, it is believed, went to the lekang islands. Andrea's luck held good; no ship made more successful trips than his own; but whenever he came to the lekang islands he lay becalmed -- the goblins went aboard or ashore with their goods -- but after a time he had fair winds, whether he happened to want to go to bergen, or sail home.
