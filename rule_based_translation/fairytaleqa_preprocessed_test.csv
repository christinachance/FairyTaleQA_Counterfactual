' by long experience the woman knew there was no good saying any more , and with a sigh she told the poor boy he must return to the forest for the axe . ' that is a good boy , ' said one ; ' i really was too weak to stretch out a wing before he came . i should like to do something to show how grateful i am . ' ' well , let us give him a wreath of flowers that will never fade as long as he wears it , ' cried another . ' and let the tiniest singing birds in the world sit amongst the flowers , ' rejoined the third . ' yes , that will do beautifully , ' said the first . and when the boy stepped into his cottage a wreath of rosebuds was on his head , and a crowd of little birds were singing unseen . the mother , who was sitting by the fire , thought that , in spite of his muddy clothes , she had never seen her son looking so lovely ; but the stepfather and the other boy grew wild with envy . ' what in the world is the matter ? ' asked the birds sleepily . ' that is our secret , ' said the doves . meanwhile the boy had reached home crosser than ever ; but as soon as his father heard him lift the latch of the door he ran out to hear his adventures . ' well , did you get the wreath ? ' cried he . ' dirty creatures ! ' answered his son . ' do not speak to me like that ! what do you mean ? ' asked the father again . ' dirty creatures ! ' repeated the son , and nothing else could he say . then the man saw that something evil had befallen him , and turned in his rage to his stepson . ' you are at the bottom of this , i know , ' he cried ; and as the mother was out of the way he took a stick and beat the boy till he screamed with pain and went to bed sobbing . if the poor boy 's life had been miserable before , it was ten times worse now , for the moment his mother 's back was turned the others teased and tormented him from morning till night ; and their fury was increased by the sight of his wreath , which the doves had placed again on his head . the day after his marriage the bridegroom sent a messenger , bearing handsome presents to his mother , and telling her of the good fortune which had befallen him . as may be imagined , the stepfather and his son were so filled with envy that they grew quite ill , and had to take to their beds , and nobody would have been sorry it they had never got up again ; but that did not happen . at length , however , they began to feel better , for the father invented a plan by which he could be revenged on the boy who had never done him any harm . everything fell out exactly as the man had hoped . by the aid of his magic mirror the wizard beheld the new prince walking in his gardens in a dress of green silk , and in a few minutes had produced a mask so like him , that very few people could have told the difference . however , he counselled the man that when his son first wore it - for that , of course , was what he intended him to do - he had better pretend that he had a toothache , and cover his head with a lace veil . the man thanked him and paid him well , and returned to his hut , carrying the mask under his cloak . in a few days he heard that a great hunt was planned , and the princess would leave the palace very early in the morning , so that her husband would be alone all day . this was a chance not to be missed , and taking his son with him he went up to the palace , where he had never been before . the prince was too happy in his new home to remember all that he had suffered in the old one , and he welcomed them both gladly , and gave them quantities of beautiful things to take back with them . at last he took them down to the shore to see a pleasure boat which his wife had had made for him ; and here , the man seizing his opportunity , stole softly behind the boy and pushed him off the rock on which he was standing , into the deep water , where he instantly sank to the bottom . then he fastened the mask on his son , flung over his shoulders a velvet cloak , which the prince had let fall , and finally arranged a lace veil over his head .

' you are my own husband , and i shall never let you go , ' she said . but the words were hardly out of her mouth when she found that it was a hare that she was holding by the paw . then the hare changed into a fish , and the fish into a bird , and the bird into a slimy wriggling snake . this time the princess 's hand nearly opened of itself , but with a strong effort she kept her fingers shut , and drawing her sword cut off its head , when the spell was broken , and the boy stood before her as she had seen him first , the wreath upon his head and the birds singing for joy .
