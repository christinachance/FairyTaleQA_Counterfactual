# FairyTaleQA_Counterfactual

## Overview 

This repo provides code for reproducing the experiments in the paper [Will the Prince Get True Love's Kiss? On the Model Sensitivity to Gender Perturbation over Fairytale Texts
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10865). We provide code for running any of the three CDA approaches discussed in the paper and the data, originally from [FairytaleQA Dataset](https://github.com/uci-soe/FairytaleQAData), is provided preprocessed for the question-answer task. We provide both the original preprocessed dataset and the counterfactual dataset developed using the LLM-assisted rule-based translation approach.
